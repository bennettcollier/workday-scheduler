# Work Day Scheduler
## A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day

### How it works:
- Today's date is shown in the header. It automatically updates to the new date.
- The schedule is color coded to show each hour of the present day. Past times are gray, current hour is red, and future hours are green.
- Tasks can be added to each time slot by clicking on the space beside the hour.
- Tasks can be saved to the page, as well as local storage, by clicking the save button to the right of the text space.

### Functionality
- The page was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
